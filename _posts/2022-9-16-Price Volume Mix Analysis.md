title: Price Volume Mix Analysis
categories: [Analysis]
---
PVM Analysis (as I like to refer to) breaks down sales by its drivers - price and volume - and measures the effect that each had in changing sales from period X to period Y. The "M" in PVM stands for "Mix". Versions of theb PVM Analysis like to add a "Mix" effect that represents the portion of change in sales that are not solely exaplained by prices or volume. Here's a preview of a dashboard a built to test PVM analysis with 3 drivers.
