This is the first official blog post! I am replacing my previous personal website with this new one, which has a nice blog functionality and looks much cleaner and modern. My previous website was actually built from scratch as part of a personal project to learn web design (feel free to check that website [here](https://brunoochi.github.io/brunoochi-old-personal-site/)).

I will try to keep this blog updated with mini analytics notes and experiments I do for self-learning. I will leave the portfolio section for bigger ideas and projects that require for time, thought, and care. The idea of having a blog is to be able to increase the rate of input/output and speed up learning!
