I am a data analytics professional working in the consulting industry. My mission is to help companies use their data to discover value and make good business decisions. I have worked with major market players from the automobile, apparel, eldercare, and construction industries in Japan.

My main tools of work are Python, Tableau and Alteryx, but I am also comfortable with Power BI, QGIS, and SQL scripting. Here's a list of recent projects I have been active on:

- Process and visualize contract data for a lease company
- Build financial dashboard for an eldercare provider
- Analyze drivers of revenue and recommend optimal candidates for store network expansion
- Aside from client work, I also work as an internal data evangelist. I lead training sessions and spread basic data skills to new hires.

I was born and raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil and I currently live in Tokyo, Japan. I am proficient in Portuguese, English and Japanese. Check my [resume](#) for details.
