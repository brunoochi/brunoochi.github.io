| Project Battle | This project uses basic NLP (natural language proecessing) techniques to analyze customer reviews of 4 well known first-person shooting games: Battlefield 5, Battlefield 1, Call of Duty Black Ops 4, and Call of Duty Inifinite Warfare. | Project |
| Project Matcha | In this project, I test pdfplumber - a Python library that extracts data from PDF - to get the number of applications and the number of test takers of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. The data is stored in several PDFs that compiles information from all test centers around the world from the period of 2010 to 2019. | Project |
| Project Flat | I created a map of Tokyo containing average rent prices broken down by district. This work was done over a weekend for hobby and learning. | Project |
| Project Car | This project predicts used car prices using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. Dataset was prepared and shared by a user in Kaggle. This project was a refresher of basic (but essential) machine learning techniques. | Project |
| Project Resolution | In this project, I use UNGA resolution data to understand voting patterns. I expect to see something that goes more or less along the lines of well known alliances such as the group of rich nations (G7), oil-rich countries (OPEC), and former soviet countries being clustered together. Will these blocs really emerge as we expect? Project work was done over a weekend and the idea was to practice data preparation and tentatively run a clustering algorithm. | Project |
| Project K | In this project, I create a developer account and set API accounts to extract publicly available data from music streaming service Last.FM and Twitter. I combine these two datasets to build a monitoring dashboard for top K-pop albums and artists. | Project |
