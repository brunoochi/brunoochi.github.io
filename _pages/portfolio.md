These are some side projects I have been working on for my learning and development. I enjoy playing around with datasets, libraries, and tools to learn new things and stay sharp for the next challenge.

| Project Name | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Battle | This project uses basic NLP techniques to analyze customer reviews of 4 well known first-person shooting games: Battlefield 5, Battlefield 1, Call of Duty Black Ops 4, and Call of Duty Inifinite Warfare. | [Project](../portfolio/PJBattle) |
| Matcha | I test pdfplumber - a Python library that extracts data from PDF - to get the number of applications and the number of test takers of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. | [Project](../portfolio/PJMatcha) |
| Flat | I created a map of Tokyo containing average rent prices broken down by district. This work was done over a weekend for hobby and learning. | Project |
| Car | This project was a refresher of basic machine learning algoritms. I predict used car prices using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression using a dataset shared by a user in Kaggle. | Project |
| Resolution | I use United Nations resolution data to run a clustering algorithm and understand the voting pattern of UN member states. | Project |
| K | I extract data from Last.FM and Twitter APIs to build a monitoring dashboard in Tableau for top K-pop albums and artists. | Project |
