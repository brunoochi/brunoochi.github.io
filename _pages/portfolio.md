### Project Battle

This project uses basic NLP (natural language proecessing) techniques to analyze customer reviews of 4 well known first-person shooting games: Battlefield 5, Battlefield 1, Call of Duty Black Ops 4, and Call of Duty Inifinite Warfare.  

First, I scrape the data from metacritic.com, tokenize customer reviews using the Spacy library and visualize word occurrences using bar charts, wordclouds, and network graphs. Second, I load nltk library and perform sentiment analysis to check whether the tone of customer reviews changed over time. Finally, I conduct topic analysis using sklearn built-in NLP capabilities to understand the dicussions points raised by Battlefield 5 players.

### Project Matcha

In this project, I test pdfplumber - a Python library that extracts data from PDF - to get the number of applications and the number of test takers of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. The data is stored in several PDFs that compiles information from all test centers around the world from the period of 2010 to 2019.

After testing the library and performing the data extraction, I conduct a quick analysis using Matplotlib and Tableau. Which location has the highest number of applicants? How is the demand of Japanese language education growing over time? What are the the areas of growth / decline? These are some of the questions that I intend to address using this data.

### Project Flat

I created a map of Tokyo containing average rent prices broken down by district. This work was done over a weekend for hobby and learning.

### Project Car

This project predicts used car prices using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. Dataset was prepared and shared by a user in Kaggle. This project was a refresher of basic (but essential) machine learning techniques.

### Project Resolution

The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is the forum of debate where 193 nations convene to discuss world affairs and vote resolutions that shape international law and politics.

In this project, I use UNGA resolution data to understand voting patterns. I expect to see something that goes more or less along the lines of well known alliances such as the group of rich nations (G7), oil-rich countries (OPEC), and former soviet countries being clustered together. Will these blocs really emerge as we expect?

Project work was done over a weekend and the idea was to practice data preparation and tentatively run a clustering algorithm.

### Project K

In this project, I create a developer account and set API accounts to extract publicly available data from music streaming service Last.FM and Twitter. I combine these two datasets to build a monitoring dashboard for top K-pop albums and artists.

The idea is to pratice data extraction using APIs. Even though I do have some experience using opensrouteservices API (for geographical distances, isochrones, and etc) at work, I have never really spent enough time to explore other major services, read the documentation texts, and do some personal work.

I also do quite a lot of data wrangling and some webscrapping to improve the quality of the data. As for the dashboard, I use Tableau Public to build a very simple visualization - nothing really groundbreaking, just basic descriptive charts.
